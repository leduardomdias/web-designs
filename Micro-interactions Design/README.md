- Subtle animations that provide immediate feedback to user actions
- Visual cues that confirm successful operations or indicate errors
- Interactive elements that respond to hovering, clicking, or typing
- Animated transitions between different states of interface elements
- Progressive feedback during form completion or loading processes
- Animated hints that guide users through complex interactions
- Delightful details that create memorable interface moments
- Motion design that enhances usability without causing distraction
