## üî§ About Kinetic Typography

Kinetic Typography focuses on making text the star of the show through motion and interaction. This design approach creates engaging experiences where the typography itself becomes both content and interface. Key characteristics include:

- Typography that responds to user interactions
- Letters and words that animate based on user input
- Text that transforms, moves, and reacts dynamically
- Animation of individual characters and text blocks
- Interactive hover and click effects on text elements
- Text-based visual feedback for user actions
- Creative approaches to form interactions through typography

## üñ•Ô∏è Components

This implementation includes:

- Animated title with interactive letter effects
- Text-based background animations with scrolling words
- Floating letter animations that respond to typing
- Text scramble effects on button hover
- Letter-by-letter animations for state changes
- Rotating text phrases providing context
- Character-level pulse animations
- Layered text depth creating visual hierarchy

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
