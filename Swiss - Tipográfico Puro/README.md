## üìö About Swiss / Tipogr√°fico Puro

The Swiss Design style, also known as International Typographic Style, emerged in Switzerland in the 1950s and continues to influence modern design. Key characteristics include:

- Strict adherence to grid-based layouts
- Clean, objective visual presentation
- Precise typographic hierarchy
- Generous use of negative space
- Mathematical proportions and geometric elements
- Limited color palette (typically black, white, and red)
- Sans-serif typography with careful attention to spacing

## üñ•Ô∏è Components

This implementation includes:

- Mathematical grid system with visible grid markers
- Asymmetrical layout following grid principles
- Minimal color palette with intentional accent color
- Clean form fields with floating label animations
- Typographic scale based on proportional relationships
- Geometric decorative elements
- Responsive design that maintains grid integrity

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Color Schemes

The current implementation uses the classic Swiss color palette. Alternative options include:

- Black and white only
- Black, white, and blue
- Grayscale with red accents
